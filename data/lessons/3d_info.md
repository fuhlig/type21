Giving text a 3-dimensional look is not *just* giving it an effect, decorating it or underline the message. By making text 3D it becomes an object and objects around it make it appealing. 
Instead of *typographic rules*, 3D rules and techniques apply:

* textures
* extrusion
* light
* beveled edges
* ...

But even smart use [shadows](#/textFx/shadow) can create a 3D look.
