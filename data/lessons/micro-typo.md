This typographic area deals with the *small* details of the written word and focuses on the legibility. Meaning how understandable and recognisable characters and words are based on their appearance.

### Tracking
Tracking is the overall letterspacing and deals with the space between groups of letters.



### Kerning
Kerning is selective letterspacing and the process of adjusting the space between individual letters.

A great showcase and learning game about kerning is [KERNTYPE](http://type.method.ac/) where to user has to adjust to the kerning. The solution gets then compared and given a score.
