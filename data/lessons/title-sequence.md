Title sequences are often used just to introduce everyone involved with the motion picture and a brief prologue to the story.
But some title sequences and credits are masterpieces in itself and well worth watching. Typography is not only used to name the actors, producers and directors but can set the mood for the film and even tell a little story - just with the written word.



## showcase
[The Art of the Title](http://www.artofthetitle.com) 39292306 is an excellent online resource dedicated to title design.
Here are some examples of great title sequence with focus on typography


[the number 23](http://www.artofthetitle.com/title/the-number-23/)

The typewritter typeface sets the mood for this mystery thriller and features historic dates and calculations around the number 23. Only text, blood spatters, fast cameramovement/cuts and music used in this.
*by the way: the movie is worth watching aswell!*

[mentiras piadosas](http://www.artofthetitle.com/title/mentiras-piadosas/) 39415551
The text doesn't act as a seperate layer so display information. It is rather integrated and blends very well into the scene - especially with great use of light and shadowcasting.

[Enter The Void](http://www.artofthetitle.com/title/enter-the-void/) 37709610
Enter the Void's title sequence is just like the movie - fast paces, light and color intense. The visual overdose is more like a preperation than an introduction for the viewer of what is coming.
