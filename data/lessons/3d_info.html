<p>Giving text a 3-dimensional look is not <em>just</em> giving it an effect, decorating it or underline the message. By making text 3D it becomes an object and objects around it make it appealing. 
Instead of <em>typographic rules</em>, 3D rules and techniques apply:</p>

<ul>
<li>textures</li>
<li>extrusion</li>
<li>light</li>
<li>beveled edges</li>
<li>...</li>
</ul>

<p>But even smart use <a href="#/textFx/shadow">shadows</a> can create a 3D look.</p>
