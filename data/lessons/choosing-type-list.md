### Typeface
When choosing a typeface probably the most important aspects to keep in mind are **purpose** and **mood**.
Matching the typeface with content in audience must be given.
Classic fonts like *Times New Roman* and *Arial* are legible and proved to fit most of the time but are overused and boring. But instead of using tricky, funny or catchy one - which can be more appropriate for headings etc. - the main or *body* text should be a well legible typeface.

To choose a typeface there is a great graphic by *Julian Hansen* that might help with the decision



### Serif or Sans Serif?
A typography categorization: serif and sans serif. 

> In typography, serifs are the small lines tailing from the edges of letters and symbols[...]. A typeface with serifs is called a serif typeface (or serifed typeface). A typeface without serifs is called sans serif or sans-serif, from the French sans, meaning “without”.

Some say serif typefaces improve readability but thats a controversial topic and also a matter of [screen vs print](#/tDesign/print-vs-screen).

Choosing between serif and sans serif again comes down to the overall design, purpose and mood.

### Combining Type

When using different fonts - e.g. for body text and headings - they should work together. Being consistent with serif and sans serif seems obvious but using both for body and heading may result in good working constrast.
Utilizing various font has to be tested if they work together. 
*- similar enough?
- too similar?
- not different enough*

This might cause confusion and draws away attention from the content. Often it is a good choice to use a font family with different weights (*bold, regular, light, etc.*) and styles (*italic, condensed, etc*).

### Spacing
Space between lines and characters is crucial for readable text. While the *line-height* should be 1.5 * text-size for large texts, tracking should usually be applied to titles and headings. For more details on that topic see the [spacing lesson](#/tDesign/spacing).


Ofcourse there is a lot more to consider when choosing type. More more information see the additional resources.
