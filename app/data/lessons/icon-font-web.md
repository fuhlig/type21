Very similar to webfont services. Selecting iconsets, adding to collection and importing the cdn version via `@import url`.
Great and easy to use service for entire iconsets.

If you want to use only certain icons from single or multiple collections to create your own set - this is the right service...or rather app. It even allows to edit existing icons *within* the app!
**Awesome**
