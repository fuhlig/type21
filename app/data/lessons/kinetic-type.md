Kinetic Typography is a technique of expression with animated text. Compared to static text, animated text adds emotion and personality to the characters.

This technique is not only referred as *moving text* but also *temporal typography* (text presented over time).

In order to distinguish between form and movement this temporal typography is categorised according to behavior or action.
