<h1>Font-Sizing</h1>

<p>The size of text is not only crucial for legibility but also for design. To control the text size in webdesign the CSS property font-size is set. The value can be set with different units</p>

<h2>Pixels (px):</h2>

<ul>
<li>fixed unit</li>
<li>equals 1 dot on screen</li>
</ul>

<h2>Points (pt):</h2>

<ul>
<li>Fixed unit</li>
<li>Mostly used in print (1pt = 1/72 inch)</li>
</ul>

<p>Pixels work fine for fixed design on desktop but with the rapid rise of mobile devices and their high density screens it is not possible to design for multiple screens.
Thatâ€™s were scalable units come into play.</p>

<h1>Percentage (%):</h1>

<ul>
<li>scalable unit</li>
</ul>

<h1>Ems (em):</h1>

<ul>
<li>scalable unit, equal to current font-size</li>
<li>nested</li>
</ul>

<h1>Root Ems (rem):</h1>

<ul>
<li>Scalable unit, equal to current font-size</li>
<li>No nesting</li>
</ul>

<p>As percentage is mostly impractical, em became the new standard unit for font sizing because its scalability and browser and device compatibility.</p>

<p>This example shows the difference between units scaling</p>
