<p><a href="http://www.artofthetitle.com">The Art of the Title</a> is an excellent online resource dedicated to title design.
Here are some examples of great title sequence with focus on typography</p>

<h3><a href="http://www.artofthetitle.com/title/the-number-23/">the number 23</a></h3>

<p>The typewritter typeface sets the mood for this mystery thriller and features historic dates and calculations around the number 23. Only text, blood spatters, fast cameramovement/cuts and music used in this.
<em>by the way: the movie is worth watching aswell!</em></p>

<h3><a href="http://www.artofthetitle.com/title/mentiras-piadosas/">mentiras piadosas</a></h3>
<p>The text doesn't act as a seperate layer so display information. It is rather integrated and blends very well into the scene - especially with great use of light and shadowcasting.</p>

<h3><a href="http://www.artofthetitle.com/title/enter-the-void/">Enter The Void</a></h3>
<p>Enter the Void's title sequence is just like the movie - fast paces, light and color intense. The visual overdose is more like a preperation than an introduction for the viewer of what is coming.</p>

<h3><a href="http://www.artofthetitle.com/title/catch-me-if-you-can/">Catch me if you can</a></h3>
<p>Another great example of text integrated into the scene. The text is not only non distractive but part of the scenes and partly even make up shapes</p>
