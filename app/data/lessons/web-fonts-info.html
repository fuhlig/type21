<p>Web typography came a long way since the beginning of the world wide web and made a big leap in recent years.</p>

<p>Web fonts allow the use of fonts that are not installed on the user's device. 
In the past web designers were very limited with typography within the browser. Possible solutions were using only fonts that were commonly installed on user's computer or the use of images. 
Plain text on images had the big drawback that they didn't include any interactivity in terms that they were not selectable and therefor couldn't be copied and pasted. Search engines were unable to recognise the text and images have worse performance than plain text.</p>

<p>CSS2 made it possible to download and use external fonts either from a web font service or via the <em>@font-face</em> rule.</p>

<p>This lesson is an introduction to web fonts in general with easy to use services. The <a href="#/web/font-face">next lesson</a> focuses more on in-depth usage and different formats</p>
