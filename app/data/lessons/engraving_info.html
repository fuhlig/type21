<p>Engraving is a technique to incise something in an object with a hard surface. Mostly known on tombstones or wedding rings. This has been practised for thousands and thousands of years. In todays design it is a common practise in print and even on the web - thanks to the progress of CSS even without images.</p>

<p>Engraved text is very subtle and elegant.</p>
